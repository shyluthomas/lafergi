The landscape is a magical mix of flower fields and inspiring mountains.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Mount Saint Victoire suddenly presents before you. This impressive limestone formation measures nine miles long and over 3000 feet at its summit. The light at different times of day shows an endless range of colors. No wonder the painter Paul Cezanne felt compelled to capture this mythical mountain in all its glory, over and over and over again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A native to Aix, Cezanne is the city\\''s most famous son. From his home, the mountain could be seen in the distance, inspiring him to create many of his masterworks here. You can tour his atelier of light and silence\\" on the outskirts of town. This is the smallest, and most frequented museum in Aix, and could lead you to believe that Cezanne simply went out for a walk and hasn\\''t returned yet. The first floor studio contains his palette, still covered with colors. It will leave a, well&hellip;impression.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;When the artist needed a break, he probably went and soaked in the relaxing waters of the Sextius spa. Named for Aix\\''s founder, the Roman General Caius Sextius Calvinus, these curative waters have been pumping from the ground since Roman times. Today, this is the biggest spa in Provence and located in the heart of the city at Thermes Sextius. Come relax in Provencal style before heading out to enjoy the rest of the city.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The famous Cours Mirbeau is a wide thoroughfare measuring a quarter-mile long and over 120 feet wide. Aix is known as the \\"city of a thousand fountains\\", and it is on this street you\\''ll find the city\\''s most notable spritzer, \\"La Rotunde.\\" At night, watch water flow gently from the beaks of swans as the boulevard sparkles with light. Then stroll over to Les Deux Gar&ccedil;ons for a caf&eacute; au lait, and sit in the same seats as Paul Cezanne, Emile Zola and Albert Camus once did. From Aix TGV station, you\\''re just minutes to the rest of the lavender-laden region. Take your France Rail Pass and hop on board the TGV to the papal city of Avignon, just 20 minutes away. In a about 15 minutes, be in Marseille, France\\''s third largest city and inspiration for Cezanne\\''s friend Vincent Van Gogh.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Aix is the stuff of dreams. Where artists came to be inspired and flowers sweetly scent the air.

Assisi is best known as the birthplace of St. Francis of Assisi &mdash; patron saint of Italy, founder of the Franciscan order, and one of the most popular Catholic saints in history. Assisi\\''s main attraction is the 13th-century Basilica di San Francesco, which contains the sacred relics of Francis and beautiful frescoes of his life. And there are at least seven other churches well worth visiting for their history, beauty, and connection with Francis or his friend Clare. The town of Assisi, with its Roman ruins, winding medieval streets and sacred shrines, has been a major Catholic pilgrimage destination for centuries and is today one of the most popular tourist destinations in Italy. Although Assisi has only about 3,000 inhabitants (26,000 in the larger comune of Assisi), 4 to 5 million visitors throng the small town each year. As would be expected, the city has become a bit \\"touristy\\" in the process - but its many great sites make it very much worth seeing nevertheless. And several sites outside of the city walls remain quiet and frequented mainly by pilgrims. The Sacred Destinations team spent five happy days in Assisi in April 2008 and have many photos to share! Follow a link below to begin exploring Assisi.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As you approach Assisi you will likely spot the town\\''s two medieval castles, which were built in the 14th century and are perched upon a hilltop. These fortresses are known as both the Small Fort (Rocca Minore) and the Large Fort (Rocca Maggiore), while in the town itself and located on the Via San Francesco, the Portico del Monte Frumentario is an especially impressive building with a series of stone arches. For something quite different, several exceptional parks and nature reserves are to be found around Assisi and a number even boast ancient Roman remains. More information about Assisi Tourist Attractions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Landmarks in Assisi are generally very historic and often religious in their nature. Highlights include the Basilica di San Francesco, the Basilica di Santa Chiara, the Basilica di Santa Maria degli Angeli, the Cathedral of San Rufino (Duomo) and also the Tempio di Minerva (Temple of Minerva), which dates back to the 1st century BC. However, one of the biggest archaeological surprises in Assisi is actually to be found beneath the Piazza del Comune and as tourists walk around on the paving stones above, few realise the history beneath their feet, which comes in the guise of the Roman Forum, accessed by a series of fascinating passageways. More information about Assisi Tourist Landmarks and Monuments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Several reasonable museums reside in Assisi and often contain many priceless religious treasures and historical information. The Cathedral Museum, the Museum of the Basilica and the Porziuncola are three such attractions, while the Civic Museum provides access to the Roman Forum and exhibits many relics from Roman days. Those interested in art should consider visiting the Municipal Art Gallery at the Priors\\'' Palace on the Via San Francesco, or the Treasury Museum and FM Perkins Collection at the Basilica di San Francesco. Alternatively, the Duomo\\''s Capitolare may be of interest. More information about Assisi Museums and Assisi Art Galleries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It is fair to say that Umbria is a very endearing part of Italy, with much to offer tourists holidaying in Assisi. If you have the time, you really should try to take a few day trips or shorter excursions to nearby destinations, such as both the towns of Gubbio and Spello. Further afield, if tourists are prepared for an early start, then day trips to Florence, San Gimignano and even Rome and eminently possible and extremely enjoyable. As the capital of Italy, if you can make it to Rome, you will be treated to some truly world-class sights, such as the Colosseum, the Pantheon and even the Vatican.

(22, 'Slightly smaller than Maine, Austria includes much of the mountainous territory of the eastern Alps (about 75% of the area). The country contains many snowfields, glaciers, and sno', '16', 'AUSTRIA', '<p>&nbsp;Settled in prehistoric times, the central European land that is now Austria was overrun in pre-Roman times by various tribes, including the Celts. After the fall of the Roman Empire, of which Austria was part, the area was invaded by Bavarians and Slavic Avars. Charlemagne conquered the area in 788 and encouraged colonization and Christianity. In 1252, Ottokar, king of Bohemia, gained possession, only to lose the territories to Rudolf of Hapsburg in 1278. Thereafter, until World War I, Austria\\''s history was largely that of its ruling house, the Hapsburgs. Austria emerged from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as the continent\\''s dominant power. The Ausgleich of 1867 provided for a dual sovereignty, the empire of Austria and the kingdom of Hungary, under Franz Joseph I, who ruled until his death on Nov. 21, 1916. The Austrian-Hungarian minority rule of this immensely diverse empire, which included German, Czech, Romanian, Serbian, and many other lands, became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements. When Archduke Francis Ferdinand was assassinated by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo in 1914, World War I, as well as the destruction of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, began.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;During World War I, Austria-Hungary was one of the Central powers with Germany, Bulgaria, and Turkey, and the conflict left the country in political chaos and economic ruin. Austria, shorn of Hungary, was proclaimed a republic in 1918, and the monarchy was dissolved in 1919. A parliamentary democracy was set up by the constitution of Nov. 10, 1920. To check the power of Nazis advocating union with Germany, Chancellor Engelbert Dolfuss in 1933 established a dictatorship, but he was assassinated by the Nazis on July 25, 1934. Kurt von Schuschnigg, his successor, struggled to keep Austria independent, but on March 12, 1938, German troops occupied the country, and Hitler proclaimed its Anschluss (union) with Germany, annexing it to the Third Reich.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;After World War II, the United States and Britain declared the Austrians a &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; people, but the Russians prolonged the occupation. Finally Austria concluded a state treaty with the USSR and the other occupying powers and regained its independence on May 15, 1955. The second Austrian republic, established Dec. 19, 1945, on the basis of the 1920 constitution (amended in 1929), was declared by the federal parliament to be permanently neutral.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;On June 8, 1986, former UN secretary-general Kurt Waldheim was elected to the ceremonial office of president in a campaign marked by controversy over his alleged links to Nazi war crimes in Yugoslavia. Austria became a member of the European Union in 1995, but it retained its strict constitutional neutrality and forbade the stationing of foreign troops on its soil.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In Feb. 2000, the conservative People\\''s Party formed a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, headed by J&ouml;rg Haider. A nationalist against immigration, Haider had made several controversial remarks praising some Nazi policies, which he has since recanted. His gradual rise to power was credited to voters weary of decades of stasis under the rule of the Social Democrats. The European Union condemned Austria\\''s new coalition, froze diplomatic contacts, and imposed sanctions, accusing Haider of being a racist, xenophobe, and Nazi sympathizer. Given the controversy, Haider chose not to join the government, but he continued to wield influence from the sidelines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In Sept. 2002, the coalition between the People\\''s Party and the Freedom Party dissolved after a shake-up in the Freedom Party, instigated by Haider. In Nov. 2002, the People\\''s Party made large gains in general elections. After failed coalition talks with other parties, the People\\''s Party again formed a government with the Freedom Party in Feb. 2003. A government plan to overhaul the country\\''s pension program led to widespread strikes in May and June 2003&mdash;the first national strikes in decades.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In 2004, Heinz Fischer, known as the &ldquo;left conscience&rdquo; of the Social Democrat Party, was elected to the largely ceremonial role of president.Austria\\''s tough laws against Nazi propaganda led to a three-year prison sentence for infamous British historian David Irving, who pleaded guilty in Feb. 2006 to denying the Holocaust. In Dec. 2006, he was released from prison early, and deported to England.Three months after elections, Austria\\''s two main parties formed a coalition government in Jan. 2007. The leader of the Social Democrats, Alfred Gusenbauer, became chancellor. Parliament passed a law in June 2007 that lowered the voting age in Austria to 16.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;On July 7, 2008, the Austrian government collapsed after months of struggling between the two major political parties, the Social Democratic Party and the People\\''s Party. Elections are expected to be held in September. The chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, announced that he would not run for reelection. The new Social Democratic Party leader and transport minister, Werner Faymann, will be the Social Democrat candidate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In September 2008, the right-wing parties made tremendous gains in parliamentary elections. The Social Democratic Party of Austria won 29.3% of the vote (57 of 183 seats), the Austrian People\\''s Party 26% (51), the Freedom Party of Austria 17.5% (34), the Alliance for the Future of Austria 10.7% (21), the Greens 10.4% (20), and the Liberal Forum 2.1% (0). Turnout was 78.8%. On October 8, 2008, Faymann was asked by President Fischer to form a new government.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;On October 11, 2008, during a crucial time in Austrian politics, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Future of Austria, Jorg Haider, died in a car crash. On November 23, 2008, a coalition was agreed upon. Faymann began serving as Chancellor of Austria on December 2, 2008.</p>', '53e354522ced4AUSTRIA.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-08', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

At the top end, take a ride on the &ldquo;Belle Epoque\\" carousel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Avignon is also a city of culture. A theater festival created by actor/director Jean Vilar brings over 120,000 spectators. Dance, music and drama come to life in events staged at historical monuments and in the streets. Although there are now two train stations in Avignon, most travelers will arrive at the brand new Avignon TGV station at the outskirts of the city. Frequent shuttle bus service is available from the TGV terminal into the city center to the Avignon Centre station, taking about 10 minutes. From the Avignon Centre station it is a short 15-minute walk to the highlight of the city, the Papal Palace. The ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century, still encircle Avignon and are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Several fine bridges cross the Rh&ocirc;ne, including the famous little Pont St-B&eacute;n&eacute;zet known for the nursery song Sur le pont d&rsquo;Avignon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;If you would like to find artistic inspiration, follow the painters for short trips into the surrounding area. The Provence of Paul C&eacute;zanne is a short, 20-minute train ride south to Aix.

Even the Romans recognized the ethereal beauty of Arles, naming the town a second capital of the empire. There are now a number of monuments still standing and are UNESCO Heritage Sites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;These cities are equal distance from Avignon, but go in a completely different direction &ndash; just like the artists themselves.

Founded in the 11th century to protect the Spanish territories from the Moors, &Aacute;vila has a &nbsp;magnificently well-preserved city wall, a historic cathedral, a number of Romanesque churches, and an authentic medieval atmosphere. For all these reasons, the entire Old Town of &Aacute;vila has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. For pilgrims, the city of &Aacute;vila is important because of its association with the great mystic and reformer St. Teresa de Jesus, better known as St. Teresa of &Aacute;vila. Teresa was a 16th-century Carmelite nun who reformed her order, had many ecstatic visions, and wrote several books. She is the female patron saint of Spain and was the first woman to be named a Doctor of the Church. &Aacute;vila contains two main shrines honoring St. Teresa, along with a few more sites associated with the saint. The primary shrine is the Convento de Santa Teresa (Convent of St. Teresa), a convent contains her relics, and the second is the Monasterio de la Encarnacion, where St. Teresa lived and where her cell can be visited.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Avila is the capital of Castile-Leon, it is 1117 meters above sea level and the entire city is a World Heritage site. One of the finest remnants of Europe\\''s medieval era, the walled town of Avila was sacred to an ancient Celt &nbsp;Iberian culture long before the arrival of the Romans or Christians. The Arab Moors captured the city in 714 AD, it was recaptured by the Christians in 1088, and had its protective walls built in the 12th century. Extending for 2,500 meters (8202 ft.) and encircling the old town, the massive walls are punctuated by ninety, heavily fortified granite stone towers. Avila is much visited by tourists today, yet in the late medieval ages its visitors were pilgrims coming to the church in the center of the walled city. The current church, begun in 1091 and completed in the 13th century, is where the mystic St. Teresa prayed. Nearby the church stands the house where St. Teresa lived.</p>\n<p><strong>St. Teresa of Avila</strong></p>\n<p>St. Teresa was a Carmelite nun who lived from 1515 to 1582.

Along narrow streets, with secluded squares and charming corners, you will find a series of civil and religious Gothic constructions. Medieval palaces such as the Casa dels Canonges, La Pia Almoina or Casa d\\''Ardiaca stand around the impressive cathedral. The Pla&ccedil;a del Rei is a square with an array of spectacular buildings such as the Reial Major Palace, the Santa &Aacute;gata Chapel or the History of the City Museum. In the Pla&ccedil;a de Sant Jaume there are important institutions, such as the Regional Parliament and the City Hall. And, of course, the Merc&egrave; Church, patron saint of Barcelona.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Next to the Gothic Quarter is the Ribera district, which is also medieval. Originally, traders and fishermen gathered there, but over the years magnificent mansions were built. Some of them have been fitted out to be used as important museums. The Palace of the Marquises of Lli&oacute; (Textile and Clothing Museum), Palau Nadal (Barbier-Mueller Museum of Pre-Columbine Art) or the Palau Aguilar (Picasso Museum) are some examples. Barcelona has many different styles in the same place - from the Gothic structures of the Santa Mar&iacute;a del Mar Church to the Modernism of the Palau de la M&uacute;sica Catalana auditorium.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;At the end of the 19th century the new urban development area in the centre of Barcelona was built - L\\''Eixample. A vast grid plan, with large avenues and chamfered corners joined the irregular plan of old districts and suburbs with the hills in the surrounding areas. The emerging Catalan bourgeoisie built up their daring Modernist mansions here. Architects such as Gaud&iacute;, Dom&eacute;nech i Montaner or Puig i Cadafalch relied on the help of master craftsmen to fill the streets of Barcelona with fantasy. Works by Gaud&iacute;, such as Park G&uuml;ell, the Palau G&uuml;ell, and Casa Mil&agrave; &ldquo;La Pedrera&rdquo;, as well as Dom&eacute;nech i Montaner\\''s Palau de la M&uacute;sica Catalana, and the Sant Pau Hospital have been declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.

The visitor is led through its different sections, from the Romanesque church of Santa Anna, to the bird and flower stalls, passing gorgeous examples of Baroque and Renaissance architecture on the way. The Palau Moja, the church of Betlem and the Santa Creu Hospital serve as guides. There are other centres of cultural activity and daily life in this area, such as the Palau de la Virreina, (now a gallery), the Boquer&iacute;a Market and the Liceu Opera House.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Barcelona overlooks the sea, and it has a waterfront that encompasses many different artistic styles. Les Drassanes, formerly a dockyard and now home to the Maritime Museum, and the Llotja del Mar are part of the medieval port facilities. Arcaded houses lead to the Ciutadella Park, the Olympic Village and the Port Ol&iacute;mpic.

Along narrow streets, with secluded squares and charming corners, you will find a series of civil and religious Gothic constructions. Medieval palaces such as the Casa dels Canonges, La Pia Almoina or Casa d\\''Ardiaca stand around the impressive cathedral. The Pla&ccedil;a del Rei is a square with an array of spectacular buildings such as the Reial Major Palace, the Santa &Aacute;gata Chapel or the History of the City Museum. In the Pla&ccedil;a de Sant Jaume there are important institutions, such as the Regional Parliament and the City Hall. And, of course, the Merc&egrave; Church, patron saint of Barcelona.</p>\n<p>Next to the Gothic Quarter is the Ribera district, which is also medieval. Originally, traders and fishermen gathered there, but over the years magnificent mansions were built. Some of them have been fitted out to be used as important museums. The Palace of the Marquises of Lli&oacute; (Textile and Clothing Museum), Palau Nadal (Barbier-Mueller Museum of Pre-Columbine Art) or the Palau Aguilar (Picasso Museum) are some examples. Barcelona has many different styles in the same place - from the Gothic structures of the Santa Mar&iacute;a del Mar Church to the Modernism of the Palau de la M&uacute;sica Catalana auditorium.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;At the end of the 19th century the new urban development area in the centre of Barcelona was built - L\\''Eixample. A vast grid plan, with large avenues and chamfered corners joined the irregular plan of old districts and suburbs with the hills in the surrounding areas. The emerging Catalan bourgeoisie built up their daring Modernist mansions here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Architects such as Gaud&iacute;, Dom&eacute;nech i Montaner or Puig i Cadafalch relied on the help of master craftsmen to fill the streets of Barcelona with fantasy. Works by Gaud&iacute;, such as Park G&uuml;ell, the Palau G&uuml;ell, and Casa Mil&agrave; &ldquo;La Pedrera&rdquo;, as well as Dom&eacute;nech i Montaner\\''s Palau de la M&uacute;sica Catalana, and the Sant Pau Hospital have been declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. The temple of the Sagrada Familia (the Holy Family), and houses such as Casa Lle&oacute; Morera, Casa Amatller, and Casa Batll&oacute; are just a few of the many modernist gems treasured by the city.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;One of the main arteries of the historic quarter, La Rambla, leads to the Mediterranean Sea, and it is one of the best places to catch the rhythm of the city. The visitor is led through its different sections, from the Romanesque church of Santa Anna, to the bird and flower stalls, passing gorgeous examples of Baroque and Renaissance architecture on the way. The Palau Moja, the church of Betlem and the Santa Creu Hospital serve as guides. There are other centres of cultural activity and daily life in this area, such as the Palau de la Virreina, (now a gallery), the Boquer&iacute;a Market and the Liceu Opera House.</p>\n<p>Barcelona overlooks the sea, and it has a waterfront that encompasses many different artistic styles. Les Drassanes, formerly a dockyard and now home to the Maritime Museum, and the Llotja del Mar are part of the medieval port facilities.

It was decided to build a large basilica dedicated to her in the city where she lived and died. The project was launched by the Bishop of Bayeux and Lisieux, Bishop Thomas-Paul-Henri Lemonnier, and received the full support of Pope Pius XI who had placed his pontificate under the sign of St. Therese. Construction started in 1929 and finished in 1954. The basilica is located on a hill at the edge of the city. It was funded entirely by donations and special contributions from several countries from around the world, based on strong devotions to Saint Therese. The basilica thus contains 18 minor altars offered by different nations to St. Therese.The basilica was blessed on the 11th July 1937 by the papal legate Cardinal Pacelli and the future Pope Pius XII. Works stopped for some time due to the Second World War, but then resumed and the basilica was completed in 1954. The basic structure, which was completed before the war, suffered little damage during the bombing, which destroyed two-thirds of Lisieux. On 11th July 1951, the basilica was consecrated by Most Reverend, the Archbishop of Rouen Joseph-Marie Martin, with the Papal Legate, Maurice Cardinal Feltin.</p>', '53e31fe94aa2dBasilica_of_St.Therese_France_.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-08', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

From soaking in the academic ambience (Bologna is home to Europe&rsquo;s oldest university), to enjoying the region&rsquo;s excellent cuisine in local trattorie, to climbing the leaning tower of Bologna (it&rsquo;s not just in Pisa!), there&rsquo;s something in this buzzing city for everyone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Bologna is medieval town located in Northern Italy in the Emilia Romagna that was founded by the Etruscans and has since thrived as a popular trade and learning center. It has a population of nearly 500,000 and is home to the oldest university in the world, University of Bologna, founded in 1088.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Bologna is a bustling, animated city full of liberal students and wealthy Bolognese families. People born here are very loyal to their city and often stay their entire lives. But it is the student population of 100,000 that dominates the city. Everywhere you turn you\\''ll catch young people protesting for freedom or walking arm in arm down the streets. While the center is often crowded, you can veer into the elegant residential areas to get a peek into the daily lives of Bolognese families. Margherita Park and the surrounding neighborhood is a lovely area of town to seek solace and spend a peaceful Sunday.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Bologna\\''s center is very striking with its medieval street plan, two historic towers, and warm colored buildings of red and orange. The first thing you may notice is that most of the city is built under porticoes, which are covered walkways. This is very convenient when you are stuck in the frequent rain or snow, but it can seem a bit darker when you don\\''t see the sky. The reason they are so common is because they were primarily offered as a tax incentive to estate developers because it was considered a service to the town. Some of the richest families chose to build without porticoes to prove their status.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Ferrari S.P.A. was created in Maranello, a town 20 minutes from Bologna. Lamborghini and Ducati motorcycles are also from this area. Every year the convention center in Bologna hosts the Motor show, one of Europe\\''s most important motor exhibitions showcasing the world\\''s fastest cars and bikes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A car is unnecessary in Bologna. The preferred method of getting around is by bike or foot. The bus system is very easy to use if you take ten minutes to learn the different lines. At the major bus stops, a bus comes every five minutes and run until around midnight. The fare is 1 euro and purchased by self-service machines onboard the bus. Tickets are rarely checked. Otherwise, you\\''ll do just fine by foot or bicycle. The train station, Bologna Centrale, is located half a mile from Piazza Maggiore, the city center and is a major hub of Northern Italy. Two major train lines run through the station. The new Eurostar is a sophisticated bullet train that reaches speeds of 180 mph with a full service bar and restaurant aboard. Trenitalia is an older, no frills line that is fine if you are on a budget. Don\\''t forget to get your tickets stamped before entering the train at yellow self-service machines located all around the station. The major airport of Bologna is Guglielmo Marconi International Airport. In order to get to and from the city center to the airport, you can take a taxi or the airport bus (pickup is outside of the train station or airport) for 5 euros.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;If you come to Bologna for one reason, let it be the food. It is informally the culinary capital of Italy and it isn\\''t nicknamed -Bologna la grassa- which means \\"Bologna the fat\\" for nothing. The market in the city center is one of the largest in Europe and has a huge array of fresh cheeses, meats, fruits, vegetables, dairy and baked goods. The best deals are the balsamic vinegar from nearby Modena and prosciutto from Parma.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Aperitivo is Italy\\''s version of Happy Hour that is not to be missed. Every night between around 7 and 8:30 most of the bars and lounges host a complimentary buffet of sandwiches, salads, and appetizers with drinks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;One of the greatest pleasures of being in Bologna is that is it an ideal base to explore other cities in Italy. You are within hours of most of the major cities of Italy or a quick train ride to the vineyards of Tuscany. For an easy and relaxing day trip, top choices are Parma and Ravenna, which can be reached in under an hour.</p>', '53e21ed7e12ddBOLOGNA.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-11', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Carnival season begins in Cologne on 11 November at 11.11am and finishes on Ash Wednesday as it does everywhere else in Germany. But that\\''s where the similarities end. As everyone can see, Cologne carnival is in a league of its own, especially in the final week when the street carnival has the city firmly in its grip. To experience Cologne\\''s unique exuberance at any other time of year, drop in to one of the traditional and welcoming bars in the area around Alter Markt and Heumarkt square or the large brewery taverns scattered throughout the old quarter. K&ouml;lsch &ndash; the city\\''s signature beer &ndash; never stops flowing there, the kitchens dish up Rhineland specialities and there is so much friendly and light-hearted revelry you would think it were carnival all year round. Every type of k&ouml;lsch has its own distinctive flavour &ndash; and, of course, its own brewery. The beer waiters, known as K&ouml;bes, remain immune to the general merriment: a certain gruffness is the hallmark of a genuine K&ouml;bes. The only thing that can dim the exuberance of Cologne\\''s residents lies some 30 kilometres up the river Rhine in the form of D&uuml;sseldorf, whose reserved character couldn\\''t be more different to Cologne\\''s wild exuberance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The scores of clubs, pubs, bars and restaurants in the city are heaving with locals and tourists, young people and students, particularly at the weekends. Popular haunts are the student district Kwartier Lat&auml;ng, Friesenviertel, Belgisches Viertel, S&uuml;dstadt and &ndash; increasingly &ndash; Ehrenfeld, traditionally an industrial quarter. Prices are surprisingly reasonable, especially for a city of this size. But it\\''s not just carnival, bars and breweries. Cologne\\''s vibrant arts and music scene also encapsulates the city\\''s lust for life. The Cologne Musical Dome is the city\\''s biggest theatre, with 1,700 seats, and is famed for its spectacular productions. Then there\\''s Christopher Street Day, Germany\\''s largest event for the gay and lesbian community. Alternatively, a home match for the city\\''s Bundesliga football team never fails to entertain &ndash; even if the club\\''s position in the league table doesn\\''t always live up to the fans\\'' high hopes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Something guaranteed to surpass expectations, however, is the city\\''s museum scene, in particular the magnificent Ludwig Museum which features works by Picasso, Warhol and Lichtenstein. There\\''s also the Romano-Germanic Museum, where the exhibits span 2,000 years of history, the Wallraf Richartz Museum, with art from the Middle Ages through to the 19th century, and the chocolate museum for sweet-toothed visitors. If the culture and excitement of Cologne takes its toll and you need some time to relax, head to Rhine Park, one of the largest and prettiest in the city. Locals describe this park on the eastern bank of the Rhine as being on the \\''wrong\\'' side of the river. Nevertheless, you can get over there on the cable car. And if, after all that, you still have some time to spare, why not head to K&ouml;lnTriangle?

It is a city that is noted for tolerance, a cosmopolitan outlook and unique sense of style.

With an almost unshakable certainty, Dresdeners talk about &ldquo;our city&rdquo;, because the idea is very dear to their hearts &ndash; and the hospitality and standard of service you receive here will surely endear it to you as well. To quote the national poet Goethe, &ldquo;an incredible treasure of all manner is to be found in this beautiful place&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Dresden&rsquo;s &ldquo;noble position&rdquo; may have been fashioned by nature, but it was the love of art and the creative will of the Saxon Electors (and later the bourgeoisie) that created its unique cultural landscape. This continuity is to be seen in the world-famous buildings of the historic Old Town &ndash; the Zwinger, the Frauenkirche, the Royal Palace, the Semper Opera House and Br&uuml;hl&rsquo;s Terrace &ndash; and is also expressed in the three palaces on the Elbe at Loschwitz, in the villa quarter of Blasewitz, in Hellerau Garden City and in the award-winning buildings designed by modern architects.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Dresden is a feast for the senses. When August the Strong ruled Saxony, he was famous for his lavish celebrations, combining art and enjoyment in elaborate productions. His love of baroque splendour is evident from the buildings and parks that he commissioned, and his collector&rsquo;s passion was the basis of Dresden&rsquo;s modern status as a centre of art and culture.

Fatima is one of the most important catholic shrines in the world dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Fatima\\''s Sanctuary welcomes millions of pilgrims and tourists from all over the world. Fatima\\''s fame is due to the Apparitions of Our Lady of the Rosary that appeared to three shepherd children; Lucia dos Santos and her two younger cousins, Francisco and Jacinta. Between May and October of 1917, the three children witnessed several apparitions. The last one, on October 13th, was confirmed by a miracle witnessed by 60,000 people known in the catholic world as \\"the day the sun danced\\".</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, appeared six times to the three shepherd children (\\"the Three Seers\\") near the town of Fatima, Portugal between May 13 and October 13, 1917. Appearing to the children, the Blessed Virgin told them that She had been sent by God with a message for every man, woman and child living in our century. Coming at a time when civilization was torn asunder by war and bloody violence, She promised that Heaven would grant peace to all the world if Her requests for prayer, reparation and consecration were heard and obeyed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Our Lady of Fatima is the title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary by those who believe that she appeared to three shepherd children at Fatima, Portugal on the 13th day of six consecutive months in 1917, starting on 13 May, the Fatima holiday. The title of Our Lady of the Rosary is also used in reference to the same apparition; the children related that the apparition specifically identified herself as \\"the Lady of the Rosary.\\" It is also common to see a combination of these titles, i.e., Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (Portuguese: \\''\\''Nossa Senhora do Rosario de Fatima\\''\\'')</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>About Fatima</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Between May and October of 1917, three shepherd children, Lucia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto reported visions of a luminous lady, believed to be the Virgin Mary, in the Cova da Iria fields outside the hamlet of Aljustrel, near Fatima, Portugal. The lady appeared to the children on the 13th day of each month at approximately noon, for six straight months. The only exception was August, when the children were kidnapped by the local administrator.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Lucia described seeing the lady as \\"brighter than the sun, shedding rays of light clearer and stronger than a crystal glass filled with the most sparkling water and pierced by the burning rays of the sun.\\" According to Lucia\\''s account, the lady confided to the children three secrets, known as the Three Secrets of Fatima. She exhorted the children to do penance and to make sacrifices to save sinners. The children wore tight cords around their waists to cause pain, abstained from drinking water on hot days, and performed other works of penance. Most important, Lucia said that the lady asked them to say the Rosary every day, reiterating many times that the Rosary was the key to personal and world peace. Many young Portuguese men, including relatives of the visionaries, were then fighting in World War I.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Our Lady of Fatima explained to the children that war is a punishment for sin and warned that God would further castigate the world for its disobedience to His Will by means of war, hunger and the persecution of the Church, the Holy Father and the Catholic Faithful. God\\''s Mother prophesied that Russia would be God\\''s chosen \\"instrument of chastisement,\\" spreading the \\"errors\\" of atheism and materialism across the earth, fomenting wars, annihilating nations and persecuting the Faithful everywhere. \\"If My requests are not granted, Russia will spread its errors throughout the world, raising up wars and persecutions against the Church. The good will be martryed, the Holy Father will suffer much and various nations will be annihilated.\\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In all Her appearances at Fatima, the Blessed Mother repeatedly emphasized the necessity of praying the Rosary daily, of wearing the Brown Scapular of Mount Carmel and of performing acts of reparation and sacrifice. To prevent the terrible chastisement at the hands of Russia and to convert \\"that poor nation\\", Our Lady requested the solemn public Consecration of Russia to Her Immaculate Heart by the Pope and all the Catholic bishops of the world. She also asked that the Faithful practice a new devotion of reparation on the first Saturday of five consecutive months (\\"the Five First Saturdays\\")</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Thousands of people flocked to Fatima and Aljustrel in the months following the reports of the visions and miracles. On August 13, 1917, the provincial administrator and anticlerical Freemason, Artur Santos (no relation), believing that the events were politically disruptive, intercepted and jailed the children before they could reach the Cova da Iria that day. Prisoners held with them in the provincial jail later testified that the children, while upset, were consoled by the inmates, and then led the inmates in saying the Rosary. The administrator interrogated the children and unsuccessfully attempted to get them to divulge the content of the secrets. In the process, he tried to convince the children that he would boil them one by one in a pot of oil unless they confessed the secrets. The children, however, resisted. That month, instead of the usual apparition in the Cova da Iria on the 13th, the children reported that they saw the lady on August 19 at nearby Valinhos.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The heart of Our Lady\\''s Message to the world is contained in what has come to be called the \\"Secret\\" which She confided to the three child seers in July 1917. The Secret actually consists of three parts, the first two of which have been publicly revealed. The first part of the Secret was a horrifying vision of hell \\"where the souls of poor sinners go\\" and contained an urgent plea from Our Lady for acts of prayer and sacrifice to save souls. The second part of the Secret specifically prophesied the outbreak of World War II and contained the Mother of God\\''s solemn request for the Consecration of Russia as a condition for world peace. It also predicted the inevitable triumph of Her Immaculate Heart following Russia\\''s consecration and the conversion \\"of that poor nation\\" to the Catholic Faith.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The last part of the secret (known as the \\"third secret) was written down in a letter by Lucia Dos Santos, the last living Fatima seer, in 1944, with instructions not to read it until 1960, this was placed in the care of The Holy See. Most informed sources speculate that this portion of the Secret concerns chaos in the Catholic Church, predicting widespread apostasy and a loss of faith beginning in the seventh decade of the 20th Century. But it is now believed that it predicted the 1981assassination attempt of Pope John Paul 11.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Fatima now attracts thousands of pilgrims from all over the world, particularly on the pilgrimage days in May and October. The large torch-light processions in the evening are particularly impressive, often lead by Cardinals and Bishops. The pilgrims gather in Cova de Iria an enormous plaza where a little chapel was built and where the Virgin Mary is believed to have appeared to the children. Around the plaza are a considerable number of shops and stalls selling various religious articles. On the far side of the plaza rises the great basilica, built in the in neo-classical style, with a central tower 65 meters high, the construction of which was begun on 13 of May 1928. It is flanked by colonnades linking it with the extensive convent and hospital buildings. In the basilica are the tombs of two of the three visionaries, siblings Francisco and Jacinta Marto, who died in 1919 and 1920 respectively, and were beatified in 1970.

Many young Portuguese men, including relatives of the visionaries, were then fighting in World War I.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Our Lady of Fatima explained to the children that war is a punishment for sin and warned that God would further castigate the world for its disobedience to His Will by means of war, hunger and the persecution of the Church, the Holy Father and the Catholic Faithful. God\\''s Mother prophesied that Russia would be God\\''s chosen \\"instrument of chastisement,\\" spreading the \\"errors\\" of atheism and materialism across the earth, fomenting wars, annihilating nations and persecuting the Faithful everywhere. \\"If My requests are not granted, Russia will spread its errors throughout the world, raising up wars and persecutions against the Church. The good will be martryed, the Holy Father will suffer much and various nations will be annihilated.\\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In all Her appearances at Fatima, the Blessed Mother repeatedly emphasized the necessity of praying the Rosary daily, of wearing the Brown Scapular of Mount Carmel and of performing acts of reparation and sacrifice. To prevent the terrible chastisement at the hands of Russia and to convert \\"that poor nation\\", Our Lady requested the solemn public Consecration of Russia to Her Immaculate Heart by the Pope and all the Catholic bishops of the world. She also asked that the Faithful practice a new devotion of reparation on the first Saturday of five consecutive months (\\"the Five First Saturdays\\")</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Thousands of people flocked to Fatima and Aljustrel in the months following the reports of the visions and miracles. On August 13, 1917, the provincial administrator and anticlerical Freemason, Artur Santos (no relation), believing that the events were politically disruptive, intercepted and jailed the children before they could reach the Cova da Iria that day. Prisoners held with them in the provincial jail later testified that the children, while upset, were consoled by the inmates, and then led the inmates in saying the Rosary. The administrator interrogated the children and unsuccessfully attempted to get them to divulge the content of the secrets. In the process, he tried to convince the children that he would boil them one by one in a pot of oil unless they confessed the secrets. The children, however, resisted. That month, instead of the usual apparition in the Cova da Iria on the 13th, the children reported that they saw the lady on August 19 at nearby Valinhos.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The heart of Our Lady\\''s Message to the world is contained in what has come to be called the \\"Secret\\" which She confided to the three child seers in July 1917. The Secret actually consists of three parts, the first two of which have been publicly revealed. The first part of the Secret was a horrifying vision of hell \\"where the souls of poor sinners go\\" and contained an urgent plea from Our Lady for acts of prayer and sacrifice to save souls. The second part of the Secret specifically prophesied the outbreak of World War II and contained the Mother of God\\''s solemn request for the Consecration of Russia as a condition for world peace. It also predicted the inevitable triumph of Her Immaculate Heart following Russia\\''s consecration and the conversion \\"of that poor nation\\" to the Catholic Faith.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The last part of the secret (known as the \\"third secret) was written down in a letter by Lucia Dos Santos, the last living Fatima seer, in 1944, with instructions not to read it until 1960, this was placed in the care of The Holy See. Most informed sources speculate that this portion of the Secret concerns chaos in the Catholic Church, predicting widespread apostasy and a loss of faith beginning in the seventh decade of the 20th Century. But it is now believed that it predicted the 1981assassination attempt of Pope John Paul 11.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Fatima now attracts thousands of pilgrims from all over the world, particularly on the pilgrimage days in May and October. The large torch-light processions in the evening are particularly impressive, often lead by Cardinals and Bishops. The pilgrims gather in Cova de Iria an enormous plaza where a little chapel was built and where the Virgin Mary is believed to have appeared to the children. Around the plaza are a considerable number of shops and stalls selling various religious articles. On the far side of the plaza rises the great basilica, built in the in neo-classical style, with a central tower 65 meters high, the construction of which was begun on 13 of May 1928. It is flanked by colonnades linking it with the extensive convent and hospital buildings. In the basilica are the tombs of two of the three visionaries, siblings Francisco and Jacinta Marto, who died in 1919 and 1920 respectively, and were beatified in 1970. The third seer, Lucia dos Santos, died in 2005.</p>', '53df51810a200Fathima.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-11', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

In fact, the centro storico is home to some of the most beautiful monuments, churches and museums of the world and attracts millons of tourists to the city each year. The historic city lies within medeival walls built around it in the 14th century after Florence began to grow due to its economic growth.

Also called \\"The Fifth Avenue\\" of Germany, this shopping street offers everything from chic boutiques, to international department chains for the discerning shopper.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Main metropolis was first mentioned on 22 February 794 in a document of Charlemagne for the Regensburg monastery, St. Emmeram. However, there is proof that the cathedral hill has been under continuous settlement since as early as 3000 BC. At the same place, a Roman military camp was established around 83 AD and in the Merovingian era, the court of a Franconian king. In 843, Frankfurt became at times the most important royal palatinate of the Eastern Franconians and the site of parliaments. In 1220, Frankfurt became a free imperial city. From 1356 onwards, the Golden Bull declared Frankfurt as the permanent city of choice for the Roman kings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;From 1562, the Emperor was also crowned in Frankfurt, the last one being the Habsburg Franz II. After the end of the Holy Roman Empire, Frankfurt joined the Confederation of the Rhine and under the First Prince Karl Theodor of Dalberg, became the capital of a short-lived (1810-1813) grand duchy of Frankfurt.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In 1815, Frankfurt became a free city and the seat of the federal government.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In 1848, the March revolution broke out in the German states. As a symbol of reconciliation, the Franco-Prussian war was officially ended in 1871 with the Peace of Frankfurt. The city expansion of Frankfurt in the 19th century began with the incorporation of Bornheim. Further incorporations followed from 1895 onwards. For a short time, Frankfurt thus became the city with the largest area in Germany. Between 1879 and 1926 important institutions such as the Stock Exchange (1879), the Old Opera (1880), the central station (1888), the University (1914) and the first Frankfurt airport (1926) were built.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Under the National Socialist regime, 9000 Jews were deported from Frankfurt. In World War Two, aerial attacks destroyed almost all of the old and central parts of the city. However, the cityscape that was practically completely in the medieval style up to 1944 &ndash; which in this form was unique for a German city at this time &ndash; was lost during the modern reconstruction of the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;After the end of the war, the occupying American forces set up their headquarters in the city. Frankfurt then became the administrative headquarters of the trizone. In the voting for the Federal capital, Frankfurt only just lost out narrowly to Konrad Adenauer&rsquo;s favourite, Bonn. A parliamentary building had already been built in Frankfurt and today houses the Hessischer Rundfunk, the public broadcaster for the state of Hesse. In the post-war period, the city again developed into a business metropolis and in 1998 became the seat of the European Central Bank.</p>', '53e0b222c70c2Frankfurt.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-11', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Austria had suffered from the catastrophic economic results of losing the First World War, had shrunk to a seventh of its imperial size, lost its international markets and suffered devastating inflation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Even the modest design of a 3-metre (9.8 ft) gravel road, with overtaking points, appeared too expensive. The impulse for building a road, which was meant to open up the barren alpine valleys to motorized tourism, was given by the New York stock market slump in 1929. This catastrophe shook an impoverished Austria with terrible force.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Within three years, the economic output dropped by a quarter, and unemployment rate reached 26%. The government then revived the Grossglockner project to give work to 3,200 (from an average of 520,000 jobless). The project was extended to a width of 6 metres (20 ft) to serve the needs of the \\"excessive international traffic\\" - which was roundly mocked - in the belief that an annual 120,000 visitors would come.

The number of motorcycles on the Grossglockner High Alpine Road then rose by 2003 to over 76,000.Increasing numbers of visitors made the stage-by-stage modernization of the road necessary after 1953 to a width of 7.5 metres (25 ft), to 15 metres (49 ft) in place of 10-metre (33 ft) bend radius, and 4,000 parking places instead of 800 and an annual capacity of up to 350,000 vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In the years 1936 and 1937, 350 men shovelled 250,000 cubic metres (8,800,000 cu ft) of snow in an average of seventy days to keep at least one lane on the road free. Since 1953, the five Wallack rotary plows, and twelve GROHAG workers, have been clearing 600,000 to 800,000 cubic metres (21,000,000 to 28,000,000 cu ft) of snow from the road and parking areas in around fourteen days every year in April.In 1937, the road could only be traversed for 132 days, but in 1963 the road could be traversed for 276 days.

Rich findings in Hallstatt and the upper valley of Hallstatt gave this village international recognition; even today discoveries are still made in the salt mountain of Hallstatt.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The region around Lake Hallstatt appealed very early to humans looking for the vital salt. There are traces of salt mining on the Hallstatt Salzberg going back as early as 2000 B.C. Great prosperity was gained through the salt trade, the burial objects document extensive and wide spread trade relations. The climax of ancient mining was definitely from 800 until 400 B.C (older Iron Age), which is also referred as the Hallstatt-Period due to the numerous findings in Hallstatt.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The mine was affected by a part collapse later on. Around the time of Christ&rsquo;s birth the area was ruled by the Romans who started to settle in the valley, while the local people continued their trade. During the 5th century with the end of the Roman dominance a cultural collapse took place. There is no sure evidence if there was any salt mining during the medieval times, except a few traces of possible salt production on the west side of the Sandling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Around the turn of the 14th century we have reliable sources since the Habsburgs took over this area as their private property. Hallstatt regained its status as an important production site. The alliance between Austria and Bohemia in the 16th century resulted in a real boom era, and at the same time the region became dominated by Lutherans. Soon the mining capacity of Hallstatt became exhausted; the forests looked like karst formations, therefore the production had to be increased in Ischl and later on in Ebensee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Catholic counter-reformation was a disastrous era for the Inner Salzkammergut, resulting in the displacement of more than 700 Lutherans to Transylvania at its peak. Only in 1781 the long awaited religious toleration became a reality. Around 1800 tourism slowly developed in this region, and the first travellers wrote in their guidebooks about travelling through the &ldquo;Austrian Switzerland&rdquo;. Tourism really took off with the construction of the railway, making the area more accessible. Since then the Inner Salzkammergut is a most popular tourist destination, which also was internationally appreciated with the World Cultural Heritage nomination by the UNESCO.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Nestled between the edge of Hallst&auml;tter See and the towering Dachstein mountains, Austria&rsquo;s oldest and possibly most photographed village is something like a mirage in the Salzkammergut Lake Region. Archeological evidence shows that this isolated village, which gained its wealth through the salt trade, has been thriving as early as the 8th century B.C.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;There are a few options for arriving in the spectacular Alpine village of Hallstatt, but the best way to experience the magnitude of this famous location is with a ferry ride across the lake. As the arresting scenery of a tiny village tucked between mountains and water comes into view, you&rsquo;ll immediately want to know more about this destination.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What could be the secret to Hallstatt&rsquo;s wealth and beautiful baroque architecture? For centuries, villagers have traded a very sought-after commodity that lies deep below the surface: salt. Bring the family to the Hallstatt Mines and travel by slide deep into the world&rsquo;s oldest salt mines. Discover a subterranean salt lake and the mummy of a prehistoric miner who became preserved in salt. In addition to a museum with 7,000-year-old artifacts, several tours are available to reveal more about how Hallstatt came to be.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;To commemorate your trip to this village, don&rsquo;t forget to pack your camera. Take a short walk from the market square to take your very own snapshot of one of the most photographed points in the world. Capture the delightful houses built into the mountain, the glass-like lake, and the amazing mountains in the background.

There are so many ways to enjoy Hamburg&rsquo;s harbor, which is over 800 years old; take a boat tour, stroll along the waterfront, and have an excellent seafood dinner at restaurant Rive, which offers commanding views of the port.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;HAMBURG suffers from image schizophrenia. To many of its tourists, Germany\\''s second metropolis is simply sin city &ndash; a place of prostitutes and strip shows &ndash; while in its homeland it is revered as a cosmopolitan, stylish city-state. Either way the cause is the same: through one of the greatest ports in Europe it has sucked in wealth &ndash; and probably vice &ndash; ever since a canny piece of diplomatic manoeuvring in 1189 led Emperor Friederich I (also known as Emperor Barbarossa) to grant tax-free imports down the Elbe. The good times began to roll in the early Middle Ages and Hamburg was declared a Free Imperial City by Emperor Maximilian I in 1510.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Today a restless boom-town, forever reinventing itself, Hamburg still flaunts its \\"Freie und Hansestadt\\" (Free and Hanseatic Town) title. And that umbilical link to maritime trade continues in a sprawling container port that grounds the city, adding a workaday robustness to the sophistication that comes with its postwar role as Germany\\''s media capital. Though the port makes Hamburg fairly grimy in places, seedy even, it adds an earthy flavour to the rich cosmopolitan stew. It brings dive bars to a city renowned for its arts and theatre; nurtures a strong counter-culture movement alongside hip media types; and helps support a nightlife that is as depraved as it is refined. Even the drizzle that blankets the city for days at a time can\\''t dampen the spirit of Germany\\''s most life-affirming city.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The surprise, then, is that Hamburg is so manageable. Despite a population that nudges towards 1.8 million, Hamburg has the lowest population density of any European city. Canals provide breathing space among the offices as they thread from the Elbe\\''s banks to the Alster lakes. The city\\''s 2302 bridges are more than Venice, Amsterdam and London combined.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Most of the main sights are located in the city centre, a seamless semicircular spread of architecture north of the Elbe, but for local character look to outlying residential districts: St Georg east of the Hauptbahnhof; or exclusive quarters that fringe the Aussenalster lake. West of the centre are St Pauli, the former port district of Reeperbahn fame, and to its north, the scruffy but rapidly gentrifying Schanzenviertel. Together, these three form the heartland of Hamburg nightlife. Things become progressively quieter (and more expensive) as you shift downriver through the western riverside suburbs from Altona and &Ouml;velg&ouml;nne to Blankenese, where city tycoons occupy some of the most expensive real-estate in Germany.</p>', '53df68f29ccc8HAMBURG.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-11', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

If this sounds interesting, then between April &ndash; October the tours start at 2pm on the Universit&auml;tsplatz on Fridays and Saturdays and the rest of the year the tours are only on Saturdays. Just turn up and pay &ndash; prices are reasonable, less than &euro; 11 at last check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re slightly less organised and would prefer to discover things yourself, we think that the best way to enjoy the old town is to simply wander around and see what you find. The old town doesn&rsquo;t cover a particularly large area, so there&rsquo;s no chance of you getting lost. The best starting point for your exploration of the old town is probably Bismarckplatz. From Bismarckplatz walk down the pedestrianised Hauptstrasse (high street). This is the main shopping street in Heidelberg and you&rsquo;ll find plenty of opportunities to pick up some souvenirs or stop for a coffee/bite to eat. As you walk along the narrow Hauptstrasse, imagine that until twenty or thirty years ago, trams used to run along here &ndash; unbelievable!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;If you have decided to buy the HeidelbergCard, have a look in the City Guide that comes with the guide. On page 23 there is a description of a walking tour around the old town which pretty much hits everything that will be of interest to the visitor. The tour takes around two hours at a fairly fast pace. You can do this on your own or join one of the guided tours on offer. The guided tours start at University place by the fountain. Between April and October they run in English at 10.00 am. The costs are around &euro; 5 for adults and &euro; 3 for children or free if you have a HeidelbergCard</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This is what Heidelberg is really famous for. The beautiful old castle dominates the Heidelberg skyline, looming over the old town. Any visitor to Heidelberg must pay the castle a visit! There are two ways up to the Castle (don&rsquo;t try and drive up there as there isn&rsquo;t any parking):</p>\n<p>&nbsp;There are lots of different things to see and lots of history to soak in up at the castle. If you&rsquo;re really interested in the castle and its history, then we would advise you to buy one of the small castle guidebooks available at the ticket office and go on the guided tour. If you just fancy having a look around and enjoying the view, then skip the guided tour. You can gain access to the castle gardens for free, but will have to pay to enter the Castle courtyard. A further charge is levied if you want to go inside (what&rsquo;s left of) the castle on a guided tour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Once inside the Castle courtyard, you&rsquo;ll see quite clearly that parts of the castle were built at different times in different styles. It really is quite impressive. In the left hand corner of the courtyard, as you face the river Neckar, is the entrance to cellar where the Grosses Fass (Big Barrel) is found (no extra payment necessary to enter). The big barrel is infact the biggest wooden barrel ever to have been filled with wine. The barrel was constructed in 1751 and can hold over 221,000 litres of wine! There&rsquo;s a little walkway which takes you across the top of the barrel (the top area was sometimes used for dancing). There&rsquo;s a little German wine ship here &ndash; you can taste the wine before buying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The castle gardens are always open and there is no entry charge. The gardens were originally designed by a French engineer, Salomon de Caus, who created (along with the help of several hundred workers) an apparently quite stunning ornate garden with waterfalls, terraces, statues and beautiful flowers. Unfortunately war and strife pretty much destroyed this original garden, which was later replaced by the current English park style garden that you can visit now. Goethe visited the Gardens during his stay in 1814/15 and you&rsquo;ll find a statue of Goethe commemorating his visit hidden away in the garden. You&rsquo;ll get some great views of the old town and castle from the garden.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Special tip: As the garden is open at night, come up and see the old town and castle lit up &ndash; very romantic!.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Now that you&rsquo;ve seen the castle and walked around the gardens, you have two choices. You can either head back down to the old town or get back on the Bergbahn and go to the top of the hill, to K&ouml;nigstuhl. It&rsquo;s quite a long way up to the top and you&rsquo;ll have to change trains half way up onto a completely wooden contraption! Up at the top you get some truly wonderful views of Heidelberg and the surrounding area. On a clear day, you can see all the way to Mannheim and Karlsruhe. There are refreshment facilities available at the top. Once you&rsquo;ve &lsquo;done&rsquo; the view, you can jump back on the train or you can walk down through the forest. It is a very pleasant walk back down through the woods &ndash; the route is sign posted, so don&rsquo;t worry about getting lost &ndash; but watch out for mountain bikers tearing down behind you! But make sure you&rsquo;re wearing proper walking shoes or trainers &ndash; high heels wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate!!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Heidelberg has a couple of nice little, bustling markets &ndash; one in the old town and one across the river in Neuenheim. These markets are a part of &lsquo;real&rsquo; German life and as such are interesting to visit. The nicest market is the Neuenheim market. This takes place in the Neuenheimer Marktplatz twice a week on Saturdays and Wednesdays from around 7am until 1pm. The markets sell a range of fresh produce &ndash; fruit, vegetables, flowers, cheeses and so on. In the summer you&rsquo;ll be able to take some great pictures. Take a look at the cars that are parked around the market on Saturdays &ndash; Porsche, Audi, Mercedes, BMW &ndash; and you&rsquo;ll quickly realise that perhaps this isn&rsquo;t the cheapest place in town to do your food shopping.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Given that you&rsquo;re now in Neuenheim, take the time to have a wander around, grab a coffee in &lsquo;Le Coq&rsquo; or &lsquo;Cafe Moro&rsquo;, buy yourself a croissant in the French bakery. Neuenheim is one of the nicest residential areas in Heidelberg and is a little off the beaten track of the tourist. Take this chance to see how the people of Heidelberg live.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The market in the old town is much smaller than the Neuenheim Market. It also runs on Saturdays and Wednesdays, selling similar produce to the other market. You&rsquo;ll probably end up walking past during your stay, so have a little look before you continue walking up to the castle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Handschuhsheim also has a bustling market by the Tiefburg on Saturday mornings. To get to Handschuhsheim, walk to Neuenheim as described in the previous paragraph and keep on walking another 10 minutes or so until the road forks at Kapellanweg. At this point take the right fork, this means you&rsquo;ll basically continue walking straight ahead and you&rsquo;ll find yourself at the market. It&rsquo;s right next to the Tiefburg (see picture), which is the ruin of an old castle and well worth a visit in its own right. This is slightly off the beaten track&hellip;. so make the most of it!</p>', '53df7d3874e3cHEIDELBERG.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-11', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

In 1498 after Christ, Michelangelo, only 22 years old, writes a contract, guaranteed by Jacopo Galli, with the French Cardinal of San Dionigi, for the realization, within a year, of a \\"Piet&agrave;\\" (pity) in marble destined to be placed in the Basilica of San Pietro.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;On a piece of marble personally chosen in the pits of Carrara, Michelangelo represents the isolated aspects of the Virgin Mary holding in her arms the body of the Christ right after it was taken down from the Crosse, according to an iconography that, during this period, had found a large consensus on the other side of the Alps. 1.74 m width and 1.95 m height, the \\"Piet&agrave;\\" of Michelangelo presents strong particularities in the anatomy and also in the finishes of the drapes, with translucent effects of accentuated by the way in which the light seemed to caress the marble superficies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;One of the things that most surprises on the sculpture is the aspect extremely young the artist wanted to give to the face of the Virgin Mary; this choice, strongly criticized by the contemporaneous, finds its justification in the abstract character of the composition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In the intentions of the sculptor, the Madonna probably represents the entire humanity and as such, using the words of the \\"Divine Comedy\\" of Dante, she is the \\"Virgin Mother, daughter of your son\\". On the face of the Christ are absent the signs of the Passion, Michelangelo, in fact, does not desire the objective representation of the death but expresses his own religious vision in the abandoned and, anyway, serene face of the Son, as a testimony of the communion between man and God sanctified with the sacrifice of the Saver.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It is said that Michelangelo, not used to firm the own works, after he had casually heard some visitors from Lombardy say that the \\"Piet&agrave;\\" was the work of Gobbo di Milano, went to the Basilica of San Pietro on the night itself, and engraved on the work the writing: \\"Angelus Bonarotus Florentinus Faciebat\\".</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The sculpture was placed in 1499 after Christ in the Chapel of Santa Petronilla in San Pietro, where it stays until 1517 after Christ when it is moved to the old Sacristy.

The attractive old town is largely car-free. Small alleyways with cafes and boutiques shape the streetscape in the medieval city centre.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The old town is dominated by the cathedral, which is regarded as Switzerland&rsquo;s most impressive piece of early Gothic architecture.

It&rsquo;s also one of the prettiest! With its ornate, Baroque architecture, Lecce couldn&rsquo;t look more different than Florence or Venice or Bologna. And exploring the city yields one interesting sight after another, like a 16th-century castle, one of the most important churches in Italy, and ancient Roman amphitheatre&mdash;just to name a few. (Find out more about why Puglia is one of our favorite regions in Italy!).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Historic Lecce is a beautiful baroque town; a glorious architectural confection of palaces and churches intricately sculpted from the soft local sandstone. It is a city full of surprises: one minute you are perusing sleek designer fashions from Milan, the next you are faced with a church, dizzyingly decorated with asparagus column tops, decorative dodos and cavorting gremlins. Swooning 18th-century traveller Thomas Ashe thought it the most beautiful city in Italy, but the less-impressed Marchese Grimaldi said the facade of Santa Croce made him think a lunatic was having a nightmare.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Either way, its a lively, graceful university town packed with upmarket boutiques, antique shops, restaurants and bars. Both the Adriatic and Ionian Seas are within easy access and its a great base from which to explore the Salento.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Lecce is rightly acclaimed as one of the capitals of the Baroque and the most beautiful baroque town in Puglia. the Broroque is a style which here has acquired unrivalled originality and exuberance due to the skills with which local architects and stonemasons worked the soft, malleable pink-tinged local stone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Lecce dates back to the times of the Messapi. It was eventually conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC. During the time of Hadrian (2nd century AD) a theatre was built together with an Amphitheatre whose imposing remains still stand in the town&rsquo;s main square, Piazza S. Oronzo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It was during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries that the so called &ldquo;Lecce Baroque&rdquo; developed, embellishing the town centre with monuments of great artistic worth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This is the most important church in Lecce. It was begun in 1353 and completed only in 1695. It has a richly decorated fa&ccedil;ade with animals, grotesque figures and vegetables, and a large rose window. Next to the church is the Government Palace, a former convent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Duomo is one of the most significant in all Italy. It was originally built in 1144, and rebuilt in 1230. It was totally restored in the years 1659-70 by Giuseppe Zimbalo, who also built the 70 metres high bell tower.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The church of San Niccol&ograve; and Cataldo is a nice example of Italo-Norman architecture. It was founded by Tancred of Sicily in 1180. In 1716 the fa&ccedil;ade was rebuilt, with the addition of numerous statues, but maintaining the fine original portal. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with ogival arcades and a dome in the centre of the nave. The frescoes on the walls are from the 15th-17th centuries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Built in the 2nd century and situated near SantOronzo Square, this amphitheatre could seat more than 25,000 people. It is now half-buried because other monuments were built above it over the centuries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The column of Saint Oronzo (Lecces patron) was given to Lecce by the city of Brindisi, because Saint Oronzo was reputed to have cured the plague in Brindisi. The column was one of a pair that marked the end of the Appian Way, the main road between Rome and southern Italy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Torre del Parco (\\"Park Tower\\") is one of the medieval symbols of Lecce. It was erected in 1419. The tower, standing at more than 23 meters, is surrounded by a ditch in which bears (araldic symbol of the Orsini del Balzo) were reared. The whole complex was the seat of Orsinis tribunal and of a mint, and after Giovanni Antonios death, it became a residence for the Spanish viceroys.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Castle of Charles V was built in 1539-49 by Gian Giacomo dellAcaja. It has a trapezoidal plan with angular bastions. It is attached to the Politeama Greco Opera House, inaugurated on November 15, 1884.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Arco di Trionfo, commonly called Porta Napoli, erected in 1548 in honor of Charles V.

Besides being a center for German art and culture, the city also became famous in Germany&rsquo;s recent history, when Leipzig demonstrators initiated the peaceful revolution, which lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Leipzig clearly has a special relationship with music. In fact, its a distinctive feature of the citys heritage. Since 1254, when the St. Thomas choir, one of the worlds oldest boys choirs, was first documented, music has struck a chord with the people of Leipzig and inspired some its finest historical buildings. The Gewandhaus concert hall, for instance, is home to the Gewandhaus Orchestra (founded in 1743) and was led for many years by eminent conductor Kurt Masur, a key player in the peaceful revolution. The concert hall also houses an impressive organ, whose 6,638 pipes provide an unforgettable aural experience. Then theres the magnificent opera house, one of the oldest music theatres in Europe, famed for its repertoire from baroque to contemporary. The impact of certain former Leipzig residents is still felt today. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach, the most famous cantor of St. Thomas Church, as well as Leipzig-born composer Richard Wagner and Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who established the first German music conservatory here in 1843. Add to that list Robert Schumann and Clara Wieck, who enchanted the city both as musicians and as lovers. The people of Leipzig themselves have a long-standing love affair with one of the oldest coffee houses in Europe: Zum Arabischen Coffe Baum has been a favourite haunt of great minds and great talents since 1711. Bach, Schumann, Liszt, Grieg and Wagner have all graced it with their presence over the centuries, as have Goethe and Lessing and even Napoleon and Augustus the Strong. A sure sign that Leipzig was, and still is, an appealing city for people from all walks of life &ndash; and not just the reserve of musicians and composers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;If you pay a visit to Zum Arabischen Coffe Baum, be sure to look in on the magnificent coffee museum on the third floor. Across 15 rooms, more than 500 exhibits spanning 300 years present the history of the drink in Saxony. For those who wish to continue on the path of Leipzigs great musical heritage, the Museum of Musical Instruments is sure to hit all the right notes. It features one of the best collections of its kind anywhere in the world, offering a fascinating insight into the citys musical history.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The marching rhythms and choirs of 1989 were anything but music to the ears of the then government, as the people of Leipzig rang out the end of the GDR. What began with church services and demonstrations in and around St. Nicholas Church in the city centre grew into a movement that brought the regime to its knees within a matter of months. One reason these events unfolded in Leipzig is surely because one of the most infamous headquarters of the much-hated Stasi was located here at the Haus zur runden Ecke. The building now houses an exhibition documenting the work of Stasi operatives &ndash; not a proud chapter in the citys history, but a significant part of Germanys recent past and well worth seeing. Leipzig Zoo delves back even further in time &ndash; several hundred million years further to be precise. Its Gondwanaland attraction takes you on a tropical journey of discovery back to the age when supercontinent Gondwana dominated the southern hemisphere. Back in the present day, you can have plenty of fun exploring the citys shops and bars. A stroll around the market square and through the narrow lanes of the old town reveals a wide assortment of second-hand bookshops and book stores, as well as chic boutiques and charming little shops. But dont be surprised if you have a tune stuck in your head as you browse &ndash; youre in Leipzig after all!</p>', '53dcafc3add76LEIPZIG1.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-12', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Lourdes is the site of a Marian apparition in 1858.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The pilgrimage season at Lourdes lasts from April through October, with the main day being August 15, the Marian Feast of Assumption.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Four to six million pilgrims from around the world visit the shrine each year and it is estimated that more than 200 million pilgrims have come to Lourdes since 1860.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Other important Marian apparitions have occurred in La Salette, France in 1846; Pontmain, France in 1871; Knock, Ireland in 1879; Castelpetroso, Italy in 1888; Fatima, Portugal in 1916-1917; Garabandal, Spain in 1961-1965; Zeitoun, Egypt in 1968-1968; and Medjugorje, Yugoslavia in 1981.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;History of Lourdes</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The origins of its sanctity begin with the fourteen-year old girl Bernadette Soubirous.&nbsp;Between February and July of 1858, Bernadette saw apparitions of a white-robed lady 18 times in a small grotto called Massabiele, near the town of Lourdes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In the apparitions Bernadette was told to instruct the village priest to build a chapel in the grotto, which many people would soon come to visit. On the day of the 16th apparition, March 25, the lady revealed herself as the Blessed Virgin Mary. During her ecstatic trance in the grotto, Bernadette began to dig in the earth until a small puddle of water appeared. Over the next few days the puddle enlarged into a pool and eventually became the sacred spring for which Lourdes is now so famous. Initially only a regional pilgrimage destination, as incidents of healing began to be reported, the spring developed an international reputation for having therapeutic powers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;From 1864 to 1872 the site was mostly a regional pilgrimage destination attracting approximately 30,000 persons per year. Initially the shrine was not known for its curative power but after 1873, when incidents of healing at the spring began to be reported, the shrine rapidly developed a national and then international reputation for having therapeutic powers. The increasing number of pilgrims eventually overcrowded the original church built above the grotto in 1876, and in 1958 an immense basilica was constructed.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Our Lady of Lourdes</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;On the day of the 16th apparition, March 25, the lady revealed herself as the Blessed Virgin Mary. She is also called Maria de Lourdes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Purposes of Lourdes</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Pilgrims visiting Lourdes for its healing qualities bathe in pools of water from Bernadettes spring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Reports of miracles of our Lady of Lourdes are thoroughly examined and evidence indicates that there are many cases of verifiable healings at the grotto.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Theories</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Generally speaking, Marian apparitions occur in Roman Catholic countries; the witnesses of the apparitions are usually young children between the ages of 6 and 12; the messages given by the apparitions to the children are concerned with world affairs of which the children had no previous knowledge; and the apparitions make accurate predictions of future events.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Regarding the reasons for the occurrence of Marian apparitions, D. Scott Rogo writes that it is \\"possible that they are projections of images latent in our minds which literally become temporarily real on rare occasions.....The key to understanding Marian apparitions may be in their tendency to occur at times of social and/or political crisis. At such times of stress, some form of mass telepathic communication may occur in the collective unconscious of the threatened culture. This may lead to the formation of a \\"group mind\\", which, in turn, results in the projection of a Marian visitation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Lourdes Rosary and Lourdes water Rosaries</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;At the shrine of Sainte Bernadette rosaries made of wood, glass, pewter and crystal are available for sale. Some of these rosaries also contain water from the holy spring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Pilgrims may also purchase pictures of the Lady of Lourdes apparition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Lourdes tours and tours of the surrounding countryside are available to visitors</p>', '53dcaf87d5449LOURDES.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-12', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

For music aficionados, it also happens to be where the composer Giacomo Puccini was born. (Find out more about other great day trips from Florence!).</p>\n<p>&nbsp; The beautiful, historic town of Lucca is an unspoiled medieval centre which is totally enclosed by walls. The town has expanded and been modernised many times but the walls have remained intact and in excellent condition throughout.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The walls are 4,200 metres in length, wide and very high. On the outside they are brick but inside they are grassy slopes with each one of the four sides of the wall planted with a different species of tree. It makes a very pleasant and interesting trip to either walk or cycle right the round the top of these walls. The views of the town, with its stunning historical buildings and its many parks is quite spectacular from the top of the wall. This trip is certainly a must for all keen photographers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Lucca has barred all general traffic from driving within the city walls and the locals tend to cycle everywhere. There are many places to hire bicycles, both by the city walls and within the centre. It is an excellent way to get around and see the city and would mean you could easily manage both the city centre and a trip around the walls all within one day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Once inside the city you will at first be a little stunned by the number of historical buildings, some even dating back to the 8th century, all of which are in excellent condition. All around these buildings there is a maze of little winding roads which disappear into alleys, lead down to vaults or suddenly open up into a sunny square filled with bars and cafes. Houses, businesses, shops, cafes, offices, art galleries, restaurants and bars all blend into together in the ancient buildings which line the narrow streets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The main square is called Piazza San Martino and it is here that you will find the unmistakeable white topped cathedral Duomo di San Martino. This unusual, 6th Century cathedral is home to many works of art, including the celebrated and locally treasured Volto Santo, an ancient crucifix and christ carved from cedar wood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A particularly good example of medieaval architecture is the Guinigi Tower. This was once part of a group of mansions and four towers belonging to the most important family of the city, the Guinigi. This is the only tower left standing and it is 44.25 metres high and and has trees growing from its top. It is possible to climb Torre Guinigi and the views make it well worth the effort. Lucca is not very large and as it is flat and contained it is possible to see all the famous landmarks, historic buildings and maze of streets from the top of the tower.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Another famous landmark is the Piazza dell&acute;Anfiteatro, a small oval piazza with entrances at the four points of the compass and stands on the site of what was once a Roman amphitheatre.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Lucca is a fascinating and beautiful city, full of stunning sights but small enough to get around easily. There are plenty of places to eat and drink and there are some fascinating little shops around the maze of narrow streets. These cobbled streets are traffic free but full of people on bicycles, which makes a pretty sight as they weave around all the old buildings.&nbsp;</p>', '53dcaf4f04e02LUCCA.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-12', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

A further landmark of the town is the Museggmauer, a wall which, with the exception only of one of its towers, has been preserved in its original, well-fortified state.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Historic houses decorated with frescoes line the picturesque town squares as they do the &lsquo;Weinmarkt&rsquo; square in the car-free old town. Lucerne is a city of town squares and churches. The Jesuit church dating from the 17th century is regarded as Switzerland&rsquo;s first sacral Baroque building and the twin towers of the Hofkirche form an integral part of the townscape. The figure of a dying lion which was hewn from the face of rock in remembrance of the heroic death of Swiss guards killed during an attack on the Tuileries in 1792 is one of the best-known monuments in Switzerland. And with its 112-metre-long Bourbaki panorama, Lucerne possesses one of the world&rsquo;s few maintained, mammoth circular paintings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Tradition and modernity stand side-by-side with ease in Lucerne, as the town has also earned a reputation for itself with innovative design. The futuristic Culture and Convention Centre (KKL), designed by leading French architect Jean Nouvel, is one the architectural highlights of the town. The KKL is also a landmark of &laquo;Lucerne: Festival City&raquo; and venue for a wide variety of cultural events throughout the year. Lucerne is the ideal starting point for many excursions to the highlights of central Switzerland. A trip up one of Lucerne&rsquo;s regional mountains, the Pilatus or the Rigi &ndash; the queen of mountains &ndash; is a must. But excursions up onto the Stanserhorn, the B&uuml;rgenstock or a steamship cruise on Lake Lucerne with its many bends and arms are certainly no less worthy. The Wilhelm Tell Express originates in Lucerne and ferries its passengers to the foot of the Gotthard pass via Lake Lucerne and then continues by rail into Ticino, south of the Alpine ridge. The &laquo;cherry road&raquo; leads from Lucerne through the landscape of cheery trees and kirsch.</p>', '53dc9890a2f2aLUCERNE.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-12', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

By the lakeside promenade are the Belvedere Gardens, where the parkland boasts not only camellias and magnolias but also countless sub-tropical plants and modern works of art.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Art connoisseurs are attracted to this city of art and architecture by the high standard of the exhibitions it hosts. In the Museo Cantonale dArte are paintings by Klee, Jawlensky, Renoir and Degas, among others. In the last 50 years, the Ticino region, and Lugano in particular, have developed into an important region for architecture. The most well-known representatives of the \\\\\\"Ticino School\\\\\\" are Luigi Snozzi and Mario Botta. Bottas Banca BSI (Viale Franscini), the Palazzo Ransila (Via Pretorio) and his own workshop on the Via Ciani are good examples.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The two closest mountains to Lugano, Monte San Salvatore and Monte Br&egrave;, give you an outstanding panorama of the town, Lake Lugano and the alpine scenery. From Monte Br&egrave; there is a walk down to the village of Br&egrave;, which has preserved its typical Ticino village centre, and enhanced it with works of art. From the San Salvatore another popular walk leads down through the beautifully situated Carona to Lake Lugano at Morcote. Taking a boat trip back to Lugano is a splendid way to round off the day. Other excursions are to the fishing village of Gandria, up the Monte San Giorgio or the Monte Generoso or to the Lilliput world of Switzerland in Miniature at &nbsp; &nbsp; Melide.</p>', '53dc996a18dceLUGANO.jpg', 'A', '2014-August-29', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Much of the shoreline rises steeply into mountains up to 1,500 m above the lake, resulting in many picturesque views including those of Mount Rigi and Mount Pilatus.</p>\n<p>The Reuss River enters the lake at Fl&uuml;elen (in the canton of Uri, the part called Urnersee) and exits at Lucerne. The lake also receives the Muota (at Brunnen) Engelberger Aa (at Buochs), the Sarner Aa (at Alpnachstad).</p>\n<p>It is possible to circumnavigate the lake by road, though the route is slow, twisted, and goes through tunnels part of the way. Steamers and other passenger boats ply between the different towns on the lake. It is a popular tourist destination, both for native Swiss and foreigners, and there are many hotels and resorts along the shores. In addition, the meadow of the R&uuml;tli, traditional site of the founding of the Swiss Confederation, is on the southeast shore of the lake. A 35 km commemorative walkway, the Swiss Path, was built around the lake to celebrate the countrys 700th anniversary.</p>\n<p>Lake Lucerne borders on the three original Swiss cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden (which today is divided into the Cantons of Obwalden and Nidwalden), as well as the canton of Lucerne, thus the name Vierwaldst&auml;ttersee (Lake of the Four Forested Cantons). Many of the oldest communities of Switzerland are along the shore, including K&uuml;ssnacht, Weggis, Vitznau, Gersau,Brunnen, Altdorf, Buochs, and Treib.</p>\n<p>Lake Lucerne is singularly irregular and appears to lie in four different valleys, all related to the conformation of the adjoining mountains. The central portion of the lake lies in two parallel valleys whose direction is from west to east, the one lying north, the other south of the ridge of the B&uuml;rgenstock. These are connected through a narrow strait, scarcely one kilometre wide, between the two rocky promontories called respectively Untere and Obere Nase. It is not unlikely that the southern of these two divisions of the lake&mdash;called Buochser See&mdash;formerly extended to the west over the isthmus whereon stands the town of Stans, thus forming an island of the B&uuml;rgenstock. The west end of the main branch of the lake, whence a comparatively shallow bay extends to the town of Lucerne, is intersected obliquely by a deep trench whose south-west end is occupied by the branch called Alpnacher See, while the north-east branch forms the long Bay of K&uuml;ssnacht, K&uuml;ssnachter See. These both lie in the direct line of a valley that stretches with scarcely a break parallel to the chain of the Bernese Alps from Interlaken to Lake Zug. At the eastern end of the Buochser See, where the containing walls of the lake-valley are directed from east to west, it is joined at an acute angle by the Bay of Uri, or Urner See, lying in the northern prolongation of the deep cleft that gives a passage to the Reuss, between the Bernese chain and the Alps of N. Switzerland&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Bay of Uri occupies the northernmost and deepest portion of the great cleft of the Valley of the Reuss, which has cut through the Alpine ranges from the St Gotthard Pass to the neighbourhood of Schwyz. From its eastern shore the mountains rise in almost bare walls of rock to a height of from 3,000 ft (910 m) to 4,000 ft (1,200 m) above the water. The two highest summits are the Fronalpstock and the Rophaien (2078 m). Between them the steep glen or ravine of Riemenstalden descends to Sisikon, the only village with Fl&uuml;elen on that side of the lake. On the opposite or western shore, the mountains attain still greater dimensions. The Niederbauen Chulm is succeeded by the Oberbauenstock, and farther south, above the ridge of the Scharti, appear the snowy peaks of the Uri Rotstock andBrunnistock (2,952 m). In the centre opens the valley of the Reuss, backed by the rugged summits of the Urner and Glarus Alps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The breadth of these various sections of the lake is very variable, but is usually between one and two miles (3 km). The lakes surface, whose mean height above the sea is 434 metres, is the lowest point of the cantons of Uri, Obwalden and Nidwalden. Originally the lake was susceptible to variations in level and flooding along its shoreline. Between 1859 and 1860, the introduction of a needle dam in the Reuss River in Lucerne, just upstream from the Spreuerbr&uuml;cke, allowed the lake level to be stabilised. The culminating point of the lakes drainage basin, as well as Central Switzerland, is the Dammastock at 3,630 metres above sea level</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '54f577ffc1effLake-Lucerne.jpg', 'A', '2016-February-08', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

St.Anthony is buried in a chapel within the large Basilica built to honour him, where his tongue is displayed for veneration in a large reliquary. For, when his body was exhumed thirty years after his death, it was claimed that the tongue glistened and looked as if it was still alive and moist; apparently a further claim was made that this was a sign of his gift of preaching. St.Anthony was canonized by Pope Gregory IX on 30 May 1232, at Spoleto, Italy, less than one year after his death. St.Antony is venerated all over the world as the Patron Saint for lost articles, and is credited with many miracles involving lost people, lost things and even lost spiritual goods. The original Basilica of St.Antony was built in 1725 by the local Italian community of Istanbul, but was later demolished and replaced with the current building which was constructed on the same location. The current Basilica was built between 1906 and 1912 in Venetian Neo-Gothic style. Visit St. Mark&rsquo;s Basilica of St.Luke.
