    The foundation of every successful company is built on two principles.  Nothing can substitute for expertise and experience of people combined with uncompromising ethics that guide every decision.
ERA Real Estate Professionals was founded in 1996 by Tom Groves. His concept was simple, to be dedicated to "The Best in Client Service."  This philosophy has evolved since he was licensed in 1972. He has been involved in both new construction and resale.<br><br>

Our three offices are located to best accommodate you.  We're centrally located near the military and resort populations of Oceana, and in Newport News to serve the entire Peninsula.
